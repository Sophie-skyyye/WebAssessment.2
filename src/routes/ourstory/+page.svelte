    Our journey began with a moment of concern and practicality. As the designated sober driver
    for the night, I faced an unsettling situation when my flatmate's phone turned off during a night out. As a flat 
    we relied on apps like Life360 for reassurance when someones on a night out.
    I didn't get the usual 1 am call to pick up my flatmate. I would send her a text 
    letting her know I'm still ok to pick her up. By 2:30 am, her phone was off, rendering conventional tracking ineffective.
    This experience made me realize the limitations of existing tracking solutions, particularly 
    in dynamic environments like nightlife. It sparked the idea for Find My Flatmateâ€”a device 
    designed to provide reliable location updates independent of smartphones
    Find My Flatmate isn't just a product; it's a practical solution born from real-world challenges. 
    It addresses the need for reliable safety measures in social settings, offering peace of mind to users.
